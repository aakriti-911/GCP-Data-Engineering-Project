# GCP-Data-Engineering-Project

Overview
This project entails building a pipeline to facilitate the extraction of data pertaining to orders and order items from a relational database management system (RDBMS). The extracted data will then undergo processing to compute daily product revenue, followed by its integration into BigQuery tables. The primary objective is to make the processed data accessible to Business Analytics (BA) developers for the creation of requisite reports and dashboards.
